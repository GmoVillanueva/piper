##### Required Installations
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- [Drivers](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/using-with-arduino-ide)
- [Board](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/windows.md)

##### Library Documentation
- [Adafruit_VS1053.h](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_VS1053_Library)
- [RTClib.h](https://learn.adafruit.com/ds1307-real-time-clock-breakout-board-kit/arduino-library)
- [SPI.h](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SPI)
- [SD.h](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SD)
- [Wire.h](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire)

### User Defined Pins
---
    Pin 13:     LED1 (LED_BUILTIN)
    Pin 21:     LED2
    Pin 34:     BUTTON1
    Pin 36:     BUTTON3 (External Button)
    Pin 39:     BUTTON2

When reading the buttons, they normally read HIGH.  When a button is pressed they read LOW.

### examples
---
*It is recommended that thet following examples are stepped through in order, as they increase in complexity.*
##### 01_button_blink.ino
This project polls the button input values and displays the button status on the LED.  The logic for the buttons is inverted.  The button reads a HIGH normally and reads LOW when pressed.

##### 02_timer_interrupt.ino
This project uses a timer interrupt to trigger when an indicator flips value.  See the basis for the example at [techtotorialsx](https://techtutorialsx.com/2017/10/07/esp32-arduino-timer-interrupts/).

##### 03_button_interrupt.ino
This project uses a GPIO interrupt to trigger when an indicator flips value.

##### 04_i2c_rtc.ino
Initilizes the RTC and displays the time on the serial monitor. See the basis for the example at [Adafruit RTC Library](https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib).

##### 05_read_csv.ino
Â¿TBD?

##### 06_play_audio.ino
Initializes the Adafruit VS1053, then plays tones and music files from an SD card.
